# neo3DSfetch

neo3DSfetch is a tool similar to neofetch for the Nintendo 3DS (you need homebrew/CFW to run it).
It's highly inspired by https://github.com/videah/3dsfetch (from which I took the ascii art). 


### How it works

To put it simple, it's not as cool as common fetch tools, it does not take the information directly from the system or something. 
There's a .ini file it reads information from. 


### How to use

Copy in your SD's `/3ds` folder the `.3dsx` file and the `info.ini` file you find in `/source`.
To edit the displayed info, edit the `info.ini` file; here is the order in which you have to write the info (every single piece of info must go on a new line):

1. user@host
1. Luma version
1. 3DS Firmware version
1. Device 
1. Screen resolution
1. CPU
1. GPU
1. Memory
